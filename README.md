# GitHub Action vs GitLab CI

Being a data engineer is creating different automations and in particular one area that’s really important is CICD which stands for continuous integration and continuous deployment and this is area where you can automate your testing your release strategy through tools like **Github Actions or GitLab CI** and I also understand that this concept can be a little unclear if you haven’t seen it in action so **this simple project will help you use CI/CD tools to automate some basic tasks**.

**GitHub Actions** is a tool that helps us automate tasks on GitHub. These tasks are called **workflows**. We can specify when to run a workflow, such as when someone **pushes new code or opens a pull request**.<br>

**GitLab CI** comes with built-in GitLab CI/CD. This makes it easy to create build pipelines and release pipelines. **GitLab runners can be installed in a variety of ways, including on Windows, Docker, and Kubernetes.**<br>
