# GitHub Action vs GitLab CI
![0](/images/01.png)

**GitHub Actions** is a tool that helps us automate tasks on GitHub. These tasks are called workflows. We can specify when to run a workflow, such as when someone **pushes new code or opens a pull request**.<br>

**GitLab CI** comes with built-in GitLab CI/CD. This makes it easy to create build pipelines and release pipelines. **GitLab runners can be installed in a variety of ways, including on Windows, Docker, and Kubernetes.** This gives you more flexibility in how you distribute work across runners, and it also increases high availability. This is because the GitLab server has less work to do when more work is distributed to runners.<br>
