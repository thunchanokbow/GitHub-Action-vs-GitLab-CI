## Store keys in CI/CD Varisbles 
These variables **contain information** about the job, pipeline, **access key** and other values you might need when the pipeline is triggered or running.<br>

To define a CI/CD varisble in the UI, follow these steps:
1. Go to your projectâ€™s **Settings > CI/CD** and expand the **Variables** section.
2. Select **Add variable** and fill in the details:

![0](/images/22.png)

- Access Key <br>

copy this variable to fill in `Key`
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
```
copy access key from Amazon page to fill in `Value`<br>
```
<Enter your value> 
```
- Secret Key <br>

copy this variable to fill in `Key`
```
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
copy secret key from Amazon page to fill in `Value`<br>
```
<Enter your value> 
```
- Buckget Name <br>

copy this variable to fill in `Key`
```
S3_BUCKET
```
copy bucket name from S3 to fill in `Value`<br>
```
<Enter your value> 
```

After you create a variable, you can use it in the pipeline configuration or in job scripts.<br>

    - touch covid19_time_series.csv
    - aws s3 cp covid19_time_series.csv s3://$S3_BUCKET/covid19_time_series.csv
```

3. To push a `YAML` file to GitLab repository, follow these steps:
- Check your **current remote repository**.
```
git remote -v
```
- To staged all the changes that you want to commit.
```
git add .
```
- To create a **commit and messages** to describe the changes you made in your project.
```
git commit -m <"Messages">
